This repository demonstrates three uncommon yet crucial error scenarios in Python programming.  It showcases proper handling of empty lists to prevent ZeroDivisionError, robust processing of potentially missing or malformed data to avoid KeyErrors or ValueErrors, and the use of custom exceptions for enhanced error management. Each example includes both the erroneous code and its corrected version.
